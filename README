=================================
https://github.com/msollami/Clique

This is a randomized algorithm for computing a lower bound on the clique number of a graph.

HOW TO USE
==========
Step 1: Compilation
g++ chromatic.cpp -O3 -o chrom

Step 2: Preprocess input graph
Use the mathematica notebook preprocess.nb to generate the optimized data structure in binary format. Change $graphPath and $repoPath, and run notebook.

Step 3: Run ./chrom
